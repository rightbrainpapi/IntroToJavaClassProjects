 * 
 *  * Describe the Science
 * TECHNICAL 
 * Source Code --> Compiler --> Byte Code --> Interpreter 
 * 
 * NOTE TO SELF
 * This is my first homework. It was fairly simple but I do expect
 * to run into some challenges a
 * 
 * Vocabulary
 *      Project: Contains 1 or more projects 
 *      Source Files
 *      Class: a class is a collection of methods
 *      Methods: includes a signature/ header followed by a bunch of statements which 
 * 
 * STRUCTURE of Classes
 *      Classes start with a capital letter
 *      Classes and methods begin with a headers
 *      In Java a classes and methods headers are called signature
 *      The content within the braces of the Class is considered the body.
 *      
 * 
 * STRUCTURE of METHODS
 *      Every method start with public static void main
 *      The content within the braces of the main is considered the body of the 
 *          method.
 *
 * System is the console/computer
 * System.in represents the keyboard
 * System.out represents the screen
 * 
 * Instantiate: to create a new instant of a class
 * 
 * next is a method of the scanner class.
 *      The next method scans until it finds a word that ends with a space.
 * 
 * \n means go to the next line escapeN

 * 
 * Note to Self: 
 * Professor said, Most programmers modify other peoples codes. 
 * They don't write code from scratch 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Programming Steps
 *  -Developing an Algorithm
 *  -Edit
 *  - Build (Compile, Link & Interpret)
 *  - Run
 * 
 * Programming Errors
 *  - Compilation errors (grammatical errors)
 *  - Execution Errors (Telling the computer to do something it can not do.)
 *  - Logical Errors (telling the computer the wrong instructions. 
 *      No indication there is an error)
 * 
 * Why Java? 
 * 
 * Characteristics of Java
 *  - Java is standardized by Oracle
 *  - Java is ubiquitous. It is Everywhere!!!
 *  - Java is a general purpose language (It can be used in many fields)
 *  - Java is a "Write Once Run Anywhere" language. (write java run on PC & MAC)
 *  - Java is Secure.
 * 
 * 
 * Strengths
 *  - Efficiency
 *  - Portability
 *  - Power
 *  - Flexibility
 *  - Object Oriented (2 Philosophy. Object Oriented and procedural  )
 *  - Platform independence (We can create independent libraries)
 *  - Clean Syntax (every keyword starts with lowercase letters and statements 
 *      end with a semi column)
 * 
 * Weaknesses
 *  - Java Programs can be overly complex
 *  - Java programs can be difficult to understand
 *  - Java programs can be difficult to modify
 *  
 * 
 * Java Organizational Units
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Algorithm
 *  - A set of well defined steps for the problem in a finite number of steps
 *  - It has to solve a problem
 * 
 *      e.g.
 *      - How to bake a cake
 *      - How to change a tire
 *      - How to compute taxes
 * 
 * Problems without Algorithm
 *  - How to get a date
 *  - How to know if you are in love
 *  - Traveling Salesman problem
 *          - Traveling to each state in the united states in the shortest 
 *          possible time and visiting the locations only once
 *          - The only method we know is by trail and error.
 *  - Chess
 *  - Halting (It is impossible for . program to look at another problem 
 *              and determine that it will stop)
 *      - Infinite loop
 *      - The Hamster on the wheel
 * 
 * Heuristic Methods
 *  - A technique designed to solving problem more quickly when classic methods
 *    are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods 
 *    fail to find any exact solution
 * 
 * - This is achieved by trading optimality completeness, accuracy, or precision
 *      for speed
 * 
 * - These methods are non-algorithmic in nature
 * - Sometimes its considered artificial Intelligence
 * - Expert Systems
 * 
 * 
 * Flow Chart
 *  - a graphical representation of a computer program in relation to its 
 *      sequence of functions
 *  - This is necessary to help us understand the problem
 *

 * ///////// Problem //////////
 * ////////////////////////////
 * Given the number of hours worked and rate of pay
 *      - Calculate the gross
 *      - Calculate the net pay
 *      - Assume a constant tax of $25
 * 
 * ex. 10hour pay 5/hour
